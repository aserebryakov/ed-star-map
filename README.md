# ED Starmap

This project is a simple star map viewer for Elite Dangerous.

Data is taken from EDDB.io (see Recently Updated systems).

## Running

Clone repository and in its root directory run

```
$ python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then connect to port 8000 with your favorite browser.

## Disclamer

This code is UGLY, but as for POC it is good enough.
BTW, this is my really first web app.
